  // This column is used only for CS2 demos to focus the camera on players.
  // It's necessary only for CS2 because the command spec_lock_to_accountid doesn't work when the current logged in
  // Steam account is the player that you would like to focus on AND if the demo comes from a non Valve server.
  // See https://github.com/akiver/cs-demo-manager/issues/775
  //
  // This column used to be the player's entity index before v3.3.0 and we were using it to send keyboard events to
  // the game to focus the camera on players.
  // Since v3.3.0, we used the recently added spec_lock_to_accountid command to focus the camera on players so this
  // column was not used anymore and filled with 0 values by the demo analyzer.
  // Since v3.6.0, the demo analyzer fills this column with players' "slot".
  // Since v3.7.0 this field is used to focus the camera on players using the spec_player command rather than the Steam ID.
  //
  // It means that demos analyzed with the app < v3.6.0 have incorrect values and re-analyzing them is mandatory.
  // This column could be renamed to "slot" but to avoid an "unnecessary" database migration this column will stick with
  // "index" as a name.
